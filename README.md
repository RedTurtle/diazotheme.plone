Introduction
============
This package contains diazo implementations of
[plonetheme.classic](https://github.com/plone/plonetheme.classic)
and
[plonetheme.sunburst](https://github.com/plone/plonetheme.sunburst),
to be used with theme base "(unstyled)". 


Any of the three theme folders can be used to create your own child
theme, based on 
[diazoframework.plone](https://github.com/TH-code/diazoframework.plone).
You can either wrap the theme up in a package or you can create a zip 
file of the folder and upload that to the theme panel.
